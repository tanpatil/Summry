## 💡 INSPIRATION 💡

With the pandemic continuing to affect our daily lives, online schooling is becoming increasingly popular. Whether it's hybrid or completely asynchronous, many lectures and meetings are now being pre-recorded and being delivered to students. Watching video lectures can be painstakingly unpleasant, because of their length and their uncollaborative nature. But what if we could turn a lecture into beautiful notes with summaries and snippets, so that we could even search through a pile of videos for specific topics? That's why we built Summry!

## ⚙️ WHAT IT DOES ⚙️

Summry creates 1-page study guides from hour-long videos, so students can review lecture material more conveniently, comprehensively, and efficiently.

## 🛠️ HOW WE BUILT IT🛠️

Scene Detection: We used the PySceneDetect package as a guide, and designed and implemented a new detector that relies on Numpy & OpenCV.
Search Indexing: We used Whoosh, an open source search engine and variant of Lucene, to index all our text generated by Speech Recognition and OCR.
OCR: We used Tesseract for OCR on the existing screenshots generated by Scene Detection.
Speech Recognition: We used Google Cloud Speech-To-Text API to transcribe the videos. We also used the Natural-language processing tools from Google Cloud to convert English sentences into numerical vectors using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).

After this we created clusters of sentence ideas via K-Means Clustering. We used Flask in Python to handle http requests from the front-end and run our video processing pipeline.

## 😣 CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO 😣

It took strong teamwork and time management to complete a large-scale project within 30 hours. To learn how to implement the BERT API, we had to learn about natural language processing at a lower level. To understand K-Means clustering, we had to re-study linear algebra 😵‍💫
The Google Cloud API helped us learn about authentication mechanisms and how to use different forms of punctuation to delimit sentences yielded different results.

## 🎉 ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE ARE PROUD OF 🎉

This was a problem that we faced in our own lives. The next time we're overwhelmed by academia, we can use our creation to streamline our work. We're also proud of the quantity of APIs and Python modules we utilized and learned about. For a large chunk of us, this project was a first exposure to more complex machine learning techniques.

## What we learned

We learned a lot while working on Summry, but some of the most important things we learned ironically were how to work effectively as a team and how to delegate tasks. We also learned about different web development frameworks and how to use them to create a user-friendly interface.
We also learned

- To effectively use Google Cloud's APIs
- Use flask as a backend
- Multi-processing and multi-threading

## What's next for Summry

- We intend to have a timestamp with the summary snippet so the student can refer back to that part of the lecture.
- We also want to include a few links to external studying resources that can help them understand the material better.
- To enable text editing after speech transcription

## Run

Clone, install requirements from `requirements.txt`, and from within `web/` run:

```sh
FLASK_APP=app
flask run
```
